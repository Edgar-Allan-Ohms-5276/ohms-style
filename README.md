# Ohms Style

This repo is a collection of stylesheets used by Edgar Allan Ohms projects and related materials.

## Usage

This project is meant to be installed from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com).

```bash
npm install @edgar-allan-ohms-5276/ohms-style
```

If your project supports SASS compilation, import the `main.sass` file:

```javascript
import "@edgar-allan-ohms-5276/ohms-style/scss/main.scss"
```

Otherwise, import the `main.css` file:

```javascript
import "@edgar-allan-ohms-5276/ohms-style/css/main.css"
```

Now you can use the components! We currently have documentation for HTML and React (Vue will be added in the future!)
